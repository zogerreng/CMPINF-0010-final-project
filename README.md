Datasets: <br/>
         **Neighborhoods**: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2/resource/668d7238-cfd2-492e-b397-51a6e74182ff <br/>
                  Description: This dataset is the base dataset that includes each neighborhood in Pittsburgh with some basic information. This includes acres, sq.                                miles, and other useful data. <br/>
          **Traffic**: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/traffic-count-data-city-of-pittsburgh/resource/6dfd4f8f-cbf5-4917-a5eb-fd07f4403167 <br/>
                 Description: This dataset details a lot of information that deals with the heavy traffic flow in the Pittsburgh area. The main useful components of                              this dataset are average daily car traffic, average daily bike traffic, speed limit, max speed, percent over speed limit, police zones,                              and fire zones. There is a lot of useful data in this set that helps to try and find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. <br/>
          **Parking**: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/metered-streets-pittsburgh-parking-authority/resource/9b68e71a-d117-41ad-81e1-af6965ea40f4 <br/>
                 Description: This dataset goes into depth about the number of metered streets throughout Pittsburgh. It gives specific details about the 
                           connecting streets and the neighborhoods that these streets are located throughout the city. This information is good in determining 
                           the best neighborhood as it will tell you whether or not you have a high chance of paying for parking when visiting that location. <br/>
          **Walking**: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-walk-scores. <br/>
                 Description: This dataset shows the walks scores of each neighborhood in Allegheny county. The walk scores are calculated based on the distance to                                different amentities. <br/>
          
Abstract: <br/>
          After analyzing the three datasets, we had three different winners. Central Northside was the best neighborhood based on traffic, Greenfield was the best based on parking and Shadyside was the best neighorhood based on walking. After looking at our datasets and where Shadyside landed on each of our metrics, we decided that Shadyside was our overall best neighborhood for a couple reasons. Besides winning the walking part of our project, it also had good scores on traffic and parking. Also, compared to traffic and parking, walking requires no payment, stress, or car for that matter. Plus as stated, there are several benefits to walking. We felt as the benefits of walking outweighed the other two datasets, therefore making it our best neighborhood.  Although it would be nice to live in the neighborhood with the least traffic or most parking, itâ€™s probably better to walk in a neighborhood where you feel safe and connected with your neighbors and community.

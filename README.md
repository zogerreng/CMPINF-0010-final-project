Datasets:
         **Neighborhoods**: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2/resource/668d7238-cfd2-492e-b397-51a6e74182ff
              Description: This dataset is the base dataset that includes each neighborhood in Pittsburgh with some basic information. This includes acres, sq.                                miles, and other useful data. \n
          **Traffic**: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/traffic-count-data-city-of-pittsburgh/resource/6dfd4f8f-cbf5-4917-a5eb-fd07f4403167
              Description: This dataset details a lot of information that deals with the heavy traffic flow in the Pittsburgh area. The main useful components of                              this dataset are average daily car traffic, average daily bike traffic, speed limit, max speed, percent over speed limit, police zones,                              and fire zones. There is a lot of useful data in this set that helps to try and find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. \n
          **Parking**: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/metered-streets-pittsburgh-parking-authority/resource/9b68e71a-d117-41ad-81e1-af6965ea40f4
              Description: This dataset goes into depth about the number of metered streets throughout Pittsburgh. It gives specific details about the connecting streets and the                 neighborhoods that these streets are located throughout the city. This information is good in determining the best neighborhood as it will tell you whether or not                 you have a high chance of paying for parking when visiting that location. 
          
Abstract: 
          
Best Neighborhood based on Traffic: Central Northside
Best Neighborhood based on Parking: Greenfield
Best Neighborhood based on Walking: Shadyside
Best overall Neighborhood: Shadyside 
Reasoning: Compared to traffic and parking, walking requires no payment, stress, or car for that matter. Plus as stated, there are several benefits to walking. We felt as the benefits of walking outweighed the other two datasets, therefore making it our best neighborhood. Furthermore, Shadyside had a relatively low traffic score which helped persuade us to pick it as our overall best neighborhood. Although it would be nice to live in the neighborhood with the least traffic or most parking, itâ€™s probably better to walk in a neighborhood where you feel safe and connected with your neighbors and community.

## Office hours

If you have questions about what we talked about this week, ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems. That being said, only email YOUR TA. Office hours will be held in the same place as usual. If none of these times work for you, please don't hesitate to reach out via email to set up another time.

## Finale üèÅ

For the next few weeks, we will be working on the final project! This week, I will explain the project and what you need to know in order to do it. Also, you'll find out your groups! Let's do this.


## Getting Started‚Ñ¢

1. In Canvas (canvas.pitt.edu), click on this class, CMPINF0010
2. Go to Modules
5. Click `Skills Lab Final Project` and click `Link to the Final Project on JupyterHub`
6. JupyterHub should open up to this week's materials!


## If Pulse Secure doesn't work for you

Use Pitt IT's [Virtual Lab](https://www.technology.pitt.edu/services/virtual-lab). I recommend using the Web Client as listed on that website. You can download and submit files to Canvas directly from the virtual lab instance. However, if you need to get files to your local machine, you should use **OneDrive**, since it it already set up on the machine. You can then download your files to your local machine from [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin/).


### If JupyterLab _still_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to your computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

Click this button to get started with Binder:

Good luck!
